#### What	is	the	high-level	research question.
Effects of early warnings, or pre-alerts, on handover performance in dual task scenarios.

#### Specific Research Question and Hypothesis
- RQ1: how do pre-alerts affect behavior before take-over including eye-gaze and suspension of the non-driving task, 
- RQ2: how do drivers perceive the pre-alerts, and 
- RQ3: how do the pre-alerts affect driving performance(how successful is the handover)

#### Key Findings


#### Data Collection Methodologies
- Twenty-four drivers (12 M; 12 F) with an average age of 32.5 years (SD = 9.6) were selected by quota sampling.
- Drivers performed two task types: driving (part manual, part autonomous), and a non-driving task on a mobile phone.

#### Data Analysis Methodologies
Authors used a 3 (pre-alert) x 2 (number of tasks) within-subjects analysis of variance (ANOVA) with an alpha-level of .05 for significance. They also used Holm-Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc tests where needed.

#### Did	the	paper	draw	convincing	conclusions	using	the	methodology?
??

#### Describe	a	few	ways	in	which	the	data	collection	and	analysis	methodology	can	be improved to	better answer	the	research questions
Due to between-subjects nature of the study, results might be influenced due to learning effects?
