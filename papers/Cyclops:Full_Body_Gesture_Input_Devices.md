## Cyclops: Wearable and Single-Piece Full-Body Gesture Input Devices

#### Authors: Liwei Chan, Chi-Hao Hsieh, Yi-Ling Chen, Shuo Yang, Da-Yuan Huang, Rong-Hao Liang, Bing-Yu Chen
#### Conference: CHI 2015, Crossings, Seoul, Korea 
#### Full-body gesture input; posture recognition; single-point wearable devices; ego-centric view

#### Strength
Different placement options allow users to use the device according to the task at hand. Wider "field-of-view" not only captures full body gestures,but also provides dedicated interaction space. I like the way they simplified foreground extraction using active infrared illumination using infrared LEDs.

#### Weakness
