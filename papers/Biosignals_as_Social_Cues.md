## Human-AI	interaction

#### What	is	the	high-level	research question	that	the paper	is	trying	to	address? In	what ways	is	this	an	important	question for	the	design	of	AI	systems?	

How ambiguous biosensing displays can provoke multiple interpretations.


#### List	the specific	research	questions	and	hypotheses.

- What type of interpretations people form about their skin conductance display in the context of  a conversation with a friend?
- What kind of roles do people desire, expect or try to make skin conductance perform within their social interactions with their friends?


#### What	are	the key findings	in	the	paper?
- Change in shirt’s display can be associated with a wide range of emotions like fear, joy or pasion when arguing a point.
- Sometimes, the ambiguous meaning of a display change was valued as a prompt for open-ended reflection.
- Ambiguity can arise either from ambiguity of observation and ambiguity of meaning.
- Most participants sought to use their skin conductance display to help them enact social performances, such as showing emotional engagement with others.


## Methodology

#### Describe	the	data	collection	methodologies.
The researchers used 5 pairs of friends (4 women, 6 men), only 2 pairs of them had experience in skin conductance. Each pair of the participants were then given conversation prompts and were instructed to fill out a questionnaire each time they see a display change.

The participants were then asked to use the prompts to have a conversation for 30 - 45 minutes. The conversation and the participants interaction with the display were video recorded. An interview for all participants  followed the study.


#### Describe	the	data	analysis	methodologies

The authors used a grounded theory approach to analyze the recorded data.


## Critique

#### Did	the	paper	draw	convincing	conclusions	using	the	methodology? Why	or	why	not?

The paper does not draw convincing conclusions on why would people use such T-shirts. Moreover, the fact that t-shirt does not differentiate between various emotional states would rather act as a bottleneck in conversations with people outside one’s friend-circle. For instance, conversing with someone for the first time might keep the person in dilemma about the actual state of conversant ie whether the conversant is happy, angry or embarrassment to have that conversation. These emotions are better judged from facial expressions and wearing a color-changing t-shirt doesn’t really resolves ambiguity. Furthermore, the authors didn’t mention what kind of conversation prompts they used in their study.

#### Describe	a	few	ways	in	which	the	data	collection	and	analysis	methodology	can	be improved to better	answer	the	research	questions.
Since the authors presented their t-shirt as a clothing for everyday contexts, they should have participants who were not friends, as normally people meet and talk to strangers within their daily lives.
