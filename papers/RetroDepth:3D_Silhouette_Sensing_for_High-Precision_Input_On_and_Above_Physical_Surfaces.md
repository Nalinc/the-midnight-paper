#### Keywords: NUI, 3D contours, depth sensing, 3D input, touch, stylus, vision-based UIs, stereo matching, contour classification

#### Strength
RetroDepth senses only the 3D silhouettes of interacting objects which greatly lowers the computation required for depth sensing. Due to this fast and precise 3D input precision, RetroDepth support all common input modalities of touch, pressure and hover in real-time.

#### Weakness
The accuracy of RetroDepth is dependent on the use of retro-reflective materials to get a uniform response. While this gives great results, it cannot be extended for in-air gesture detection where there is no retro-reflective surface in the background.

#### Future Work
It would be interesting to see how RetroDepth's 3D input precision varies if there are no retro-reflective surface in the background.
