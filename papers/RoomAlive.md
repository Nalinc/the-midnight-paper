#### Authors: Brett Jones, Rajinder Sodhi, Michael Murdock, Ravish Mehra, Hrvoje Benko, Andrew D. Wilson, Eyal Ofek, Blair MacIntyre, Nikunj Raghuvanshi, Lior Shapira
#### Conference: UIST 2014, October 5â€“8, 2014, Honolulu, HI, USA
#### Keywords: Projection mapping; spatial augmented reality; projector- camera system

#### Strength
I like the way RoomAlive expands the gaming experience outside of screens using scalable projector system that adapts gaming content to the environment.

#### Weakness
RoomAlive does not seem to support a wide variety of interactions due to latencies involved in real-time projector camera systems. This latency can not only arise from projectors themselves, but also come from depth-camera, graphics card and processing.

#### Future Work
I would like to extend Roomalive by creating a virtual pet that can move around the house and play with humans.
