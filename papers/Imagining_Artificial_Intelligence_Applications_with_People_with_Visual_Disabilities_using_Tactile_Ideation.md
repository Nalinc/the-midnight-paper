#### Specific Research Question and Hypothesis

#### Key Findings
- Researchers collected 66 ideas of which 28 are from the UK and rest from India.
- Four of the imagined sixth senses were not specific to people with a visual disability, focusing on “knowing the future” or “diag- nosing illness through feeling the hand.”
- Forty of the remaining 62 ideas mentioned people in some way. While


#### Data Collection Methodologies
Researchers carried out two settings of workshops based on two types of idea generation techniques: derivative ideas and symbiotic ideas. The workshop concept was built around the notion of a sixth sense, or a superpower, that the participants would like to have. The workshop consists of two activity sessions:
- The first session starts by asking people in small groups to de- scribe, with the support of an object they are asked to bring, a sixth sense or super power that they would like to have.
- Second set of activities starts with a discussion of what artificial intelligence technologies are capable of now and what is predicted they might be capable of in 10 years' time.


#### Data Analysis Methodologies
All of the workshops were video and audio recorded. The facili- tators of each group also took notes during and after the session. Each workshop group had two people draw out the ideas which were then placed in a spreadsheet
