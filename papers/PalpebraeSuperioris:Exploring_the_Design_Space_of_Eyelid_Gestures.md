## Palpebrae Superioris: Exploring the Design Space of Eyelid Gestures

#### Authors: Ricardo Jota and Daniel Wigdor

#### Keywords: Eyelid gestures

#### Strength
This paper covers the design space provided by eyelid gestures and also explores its application in different non-accessibility scenarios such as mobile devices and surface computing. This is a significant contribution because, despite eyelid gestures being less prone to false positives, they have not gained sufficient popularity in literature over eye gazing gestures.

#### Weakness
Though less prone to false positives over tracking the gaze,  most of the eyelid gestures within the proposed design space are either not feasible to execute, or uncomfortable to sustain over time. Moreover, prolonged interactions using eyelid gestures might create socially awkward situations.

#### Future Work
I would like to integrate eyelid gestures with certain games where it is more natural for users to wink, blink and squint. For instance, in shooting games, a wink gesture might mean zooming-in the sniper shot aimed on a target, indicating the necessity of a precision kill. It would also be interesting to integrate eyelid gestures with other input modalities for a socially acceptable interaction.
