## WorldKit: Rapid and Easy Creation of Ad-hoc Interactive Applications on Everyday Surfaces

#### Authors: Robert Xiao, Chris Harrison, Scott E. Hudson
#### Conference: CHI 2013, April 27â€“May 2, 2013, Paris, France.
#### Keywords: Interactive spaces; touch; smart rooms; augmented reality; depth sensing; ubiquitous computing; surface computing.

#### Strength
Mounting depth camera on top of the projector was a clever idea. It not only allowed the two units to be placed in the same location without producing significant blind spots, but also ensured that users receive feedback in the form of their own shadow if they occlude the view of the camera.

#### Weakness
Resolution of sensing and graphics was not compatible. While the projector displayed imagery at a resolution of 1024x768 over a potentially wide area, depth camera only gave a 320x240 pixel depth image and a 640x480 RGB image. This means there were possible blind spots on certain areas of the projected surface.

#### Future Work
It would be interesting to explore the design space of interactors in real world. Additionally, adding an option to add a voice input to instantiate various interactors could be an interesting extension.
