## TouchLight - An Imaging Touch Screen and Display for Gesture-Based Interaction

#### Authors: Andrew D. Wilson
#### Conference: International conference on Multimodal interfaces, NY 2004
#### Keywords: Computer vision, gesture recognition, computer human interaction, displays, videoconferencing

#### Strength
The most amazing aspect of TouchLight is the way author managed to project and capture the objects situated behind the screen at the same time. Restricting the projected light to the visible spectrum and sensed light to the IR spectrum is a clever way to avoid interference of 'projected image' with the 'image captured from camera'.

#### Weakness
The setup needs really controlled indoor lighting conditions to properly capture and project the images on the transparent sheet of acrylic plastic. This prevents the use of TouchLight in outdoor settings, or even in public places like malls where lighting conditions vary throughout the day.

#### Future Work
I would like to extend TouchLight to display three-dimensional holographic images through video projection. If the cameras behind the screen can detect where the viewer is standing on the other side of the screen, we can possibly adjust the projection on the screen to create a very convincing holographic illusion.
