## Prefab: Implementing Advanced Behaviors Using Pixel-Based Reverse Engineering of Interface Structure

#### Authors: Morgan Dixon and James Fogarty
#### Conference: CHI 2010, April 10â€“15, 2010, Atlanta, Georgia, USA
#### Keywords: Prefab, user interface toolkits, pixel-based reverse engineering.

#### Strength
The biggest strength of this paper is the concept of reverse engineering interface structure by identifying pre-fabricated units and then modeling their relations.

#### Weakness
Authors only seemed to test Prefab on Windows system and Macintosh OS X. No user studies has been done in Linux environment.

#### Future Work
It would be interesting to see how well PreFab scales across different environments and how effective it is under the Linux environment.
