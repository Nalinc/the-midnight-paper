Hello World

Welcome to The Midnight Paper. 

I started this project as a way to organize my readings and keep important notes from research papers I read (usually at midnight). Althought it is mostly for my own reference, feel free to peek through the [list of all the papers](papers/) I've covered so far. Since most of the papers I read are different, I follow different templates to summarize each of them.

#### Templates
- [Computer Vision in HCI](templates/cv_in_hci.md)
- [Human AI interaction](templates/human_ai.md)
