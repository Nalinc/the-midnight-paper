Hello World! Welcome to The Midnight Paper (`/tmp`). 

I started this project as a way to organize my readings and keep important notes from research papers I read (usually at midnight). Although it is mostly for my own reference, feel free to peek through the [list of all the papers](papers/) I've covered so far. Since most of the papers I read are different, I follow different [templates](templates/) to summarize each of them. 

I also consider this place as a respository to keep notes from top-tire conferences in Machine Learning ([NIPS/NeurIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_on_Neural_Information_Processing_Systems), [ICML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Conference_on_Machine_Learning)) and Human-Computer-Interaction (premier [SIGCHI conferences](https://sigchi.org) like [CHI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_on_Human_Factors_in_Computing_Systems) and [UIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_Symposium_on_User_Interface_Software_and_Technology)).
